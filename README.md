### Dataset Description  

This dataset contains **Years of Experience** and corresponding **Salaries**, designed for teaching **Simple Linear Regression**. The goal is to build a model that estimates the relationship between work experience and salary.  

- **Features**:  
  - `YearsExperience` (Independent Variable) – Number of years a person has worked.  
  - `Salary` (Dependent Variable) – The salary earned in USD.  

- **Usage**:  
  This dataset is used to demonstrate how linear regression works by training a model to predict salaries based on years of experience.  

- **Train/Test Split**:  
  - **80% Training Set** – Used to train the model.  
  - **20% Testing Set** – Used to evaluate the model's accuracy.  

By training the model, we aim to find the best-fit line using the equation:  
\[
Salary = m \times YearsExperience + b
\]
Where:  
- **m (slope)** ≈ 9332.9  
- **b (intercept)** ≈ 25609.9  

This dataset provides a simple yet effective way to understand **linear regression fundamentals** and how models generalize to unseen data.
